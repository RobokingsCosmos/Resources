SDKs for developement on PS3

@rhynec has prepared two github repos which provide pre-compiled PSL1GHT toolchains:
• SDK-Mirror : Mirrored and re-packaged pre-compiled toolchains from various authors.
• SDK-Build : Automated builds of the PSL1GHT toolchain, with the psdk variant meant as a re-creation of PSDK3v2 for Linux (using gcc 4), and the ps3dev-latest variant being a working build of latest ps3dev sources (using an older commit to PSL1GHT, since newer commits seems to break builds).
