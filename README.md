# SDKs for developement on PS3
@rhynec have prepared to github repos which provide pre-compiled PSL1GHT toolchains, tested to be working correctly:
- [SDK-Mirror](https://github.com/PS3SDK-Misc/SDK-Mirror): Mirrored and re-packaged pre-compiled toolchains from various authors.
- [SDK-Build](https://github.com/rhynec/PS3SDK-Build): Automated builds of the PSL1GHT toolchain, with the psdk variant meant as a re-creation of PSDK3v2 for Linux (using gcc 4), and the ps3dev-latest variant being a working build of latest ps3dev sources (using an older commit to PSL1GHT, since newer commits seems to break builds).
